error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:SidneyEmeka/datavisualizaation.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

This occurs when your local repository is out of sync with the remote repository on GitHub. The remote repository has commits that your local repository doesn't have.
Solution
git pull --rebase origin main
